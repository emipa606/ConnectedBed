# Connected Bed



## New! Bed Connector

You can build it over ANY other bed and get all the features of Connected Bed!
Extra cool feature: Gene Extractors, Core scanners, and any other enterable buildings are also supported!

So now your pawns won't starve or pee their pants while you pull their brains and genes out!

## Connected Bed

A new hospital bed with 4 cool features:
[olist]
- Integrated nutrient paste dripper (requires [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2920385763](VNPE))
- Automatic blood draining from prisoners (requires [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2963116383](VRE-S))
- Automatic blood transfusion for everyone (requires [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2963116383](VRE-S))
- Optional connection to [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=836308268](DBH) for water and bladder needs
[/olist]

You can use it with both [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2920385763]Vanilla Races Expanded - Sanguophage[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2963116383](Vanilla Nutrient Paste Expanded) simultaneously or with just one of them.


- fully mimics vanilla Hospital Bed
- requires research of Hospital Beds and Nutrient Paste (both vanilla)
- stuffable
- costs 110 metallic + 6 components
- requires construction skill 10 to build
- consumes 25 power (VNPE external dripper needs 50)
- safe to add/remove mid-game
- configurable thresholds in mod's config



Still no custom textures here (I've got trotter hands), just slightly greenish handles, like most VNPE things.
